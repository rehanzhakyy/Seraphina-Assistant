# Seraphina Assistant

## Description
Seraphina Assistant is a chatbot program that focuses on helping users who have unanswered questions on the Seraphina Clinic website. In developing Seraphina Clinic as a website, it uses HTML, SCSS, and Javascript technology. Then for the Seraphina Assistant itself, the development uses tools from IBM, namely Watson Assistant, which then integrate to be mutually helpful to one another. Because this program is new, there may still be deficiencies in word variations, questions, and the like. In the future, things like this will be further developed for the better.
